Hey, I'm Sharath Mohan, a data scientist making and breaking (mostly breaking..) things using Python.

I am currently a Data Science Consultant at Krypc, working on making Web3 Transactions safer and intuitive. At the same time, I am undertaking a Post Graduate Course in Full Stack Software Development at Lambton College, Toronto.

Here are some technologies I have been working with:

* Python
* Sql
* Tableau
* MLFlow
* Apache Spark
* Apache Airflow
* Google Cloud

Outside of work, I'm interested in exploring and experiencing the world. I also play soccer. And enjoy gardening.
