Hey, I'm Sharath, a passionate data scientist making and breaking (mostly breaking..) things using Python.

Currently, I apply my expertise as a Data Science Consultant at Krypc, working on making Web3 Transactions safer and intuitive. At the same time, I'm pursuing a Post Graduate Certification in Full Stack Software Development at Lambton College, Toronto.

Here are some technologies I have been working with:

* Python
* Sql
* Tableau
* MLFlow
* Apache Spark
* Apache Airflow
* Google Cloud

Outside of work, I'm interested in exploring and experiencing the world. I also play soccer. And enjoy gardening.

Let's uncover the stories data has to tell together!
